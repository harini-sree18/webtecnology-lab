    <h1>cerebrum</h1>
    <p>The cerebrum is the uppermost part of the brain. It contains two hemispheres split by a central fissure. <br>

The cerebrum itself contains the major lobes of the brain and is responsible for receiving and giving meaning to information from the sense organs, as well as controlling the body.<br>

The cerebrum does not make up the entire brain, however. The cerebellum and brainstem sit below the cerebrum and work alongside it to control the voluntary actions in the body.<br>

Keep reading to learn more about the cerebrum, including its various elements and how they work together.br</p>
