  <h1>corpus callosum</h1>
    <p>The corpus callosum connects the left side of the brain to the right side, each side being known as a hemisphere. The connection allows information to pass between the two halves.<br>

Corpus callosum is Latin for “tough body,” and the corpus callosum is the largest connective pathway in the brain, being made up of more than 200 million nerve fibers. <br>

Very occasionally, a person will be born without a corpus callosum. This is known as agenesis of the corpus callosum, and it causes a wide variety of physical and behavioral symptoms.<br></p>
